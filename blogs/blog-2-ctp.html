          In the realm of volunteering, I've found a home at
          <a href="http://changingthepresent.org" class="text-info"
            >Changing the Present</a
          >, a beacon of hope in the non-profit universe, aptly dubbed the
          <span class=""> "Amazon.com of the non-profit world"</span>
          by <span class="text-warning"> The New York Times</span>. This journey
          has been nothing short of transformative, a tapestry woven with
          threads of learning, impact, and a profound sense of purpose.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-muted">
          I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity to volunteer as a
          <span class="">data science intern</span> at
          <a href="http://changingthepresent.org" class="text-info"
            >Changing the Present</a
          >. Under the leadership of
          <span class="">founder and CEO</span>
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tolmach" class="text-info"
            >Robert Tolmach</a
          >, Changing the Present is revolutionizing charitable giving by making
          it easy for donors to directly fund specific projects at non-profits
          around the world. <span class="">Working directly with him</span> has
          been a privilege beyond measure. It's not just about the data; it's
          about understanding the heartbeat of this organization, feeling the
          pulse of its mission.
        </p>

        <p class="text-muted">
          A significant portion of my days is spent navigating the world of
          spreadsheets, unearthing insights, and aiding
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tolmach" class="text-info"
            >Rob</a
          >
          in charting the course forward. It's remarkable how something as
          seemingly mundane as <span class="">Excel</span> can be the canvas for
          so much change. Each row and column tells a story, each formula a
          potential for impact.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-muted">
          Yet, it's not confined to cells and formulas. My
          <span class="">AI/ML expertise</span> finds its wings here, soaring
          beyond the confines of data points. It's about envisioning a future
          where
          <a href="http://changingthepresent.org" class="text-info"
            >Changing the Present's</a
          >
          reach stretches far and wide, where more hearts beat in rhythm with
          its cause. It's about strategizing, innovating, and finding novel ways
          to recruit more warriors for this noble battle.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-muted">
          In this journey, I've come to understand that volunteering isn't just
          about giving time; it's about investing in a
          <span class="">vision</span>, in a shared dream of a better world.
          It's about making a vote for the kind of community we want to live in,
          not just once a year, but every single day.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-muted">
          <span class="fw-bold">
            Here are some of the key takeaways from my volunteering
            voyage:</span
          >
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="fw-bold">The Power of Data:</span> In the world of
            non-profits, data isn't just numbers; it's the compass that guides
            decisions. Every data point holds a clue, every trend a potential
            insight.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="fw-bold">The Human Element:</span> Beyond the
            spreadsheets and algorithms, it's the people that fuel the engine of
            change. Rob's dedication is a testament to the impact a single
            individual can have.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="fw-bold">The Ripple Effect:</span>
            Volunteering isn't just a singular act; it's a stone cast into a
            pond, creating ripples that touch lives far beyond what we can see.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="fw-bold">The Joy of Purpose:</span> There's a unique
            joy in knowing that every analysis, every insight, contributes to a
            cause larger than oneself.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mt-4 text-muted">
          As I pen down these thoughts, I'm filled with gratitude - for this
          opportunity, for the lives touched, and for the journey that's only
          just begun. In the tapestry of volunteering, each thread counts, each
          stitch matters. Together, we weave a narrative of change, one data
          point, one insight, at a time.
