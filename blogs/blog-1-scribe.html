        <p class="mt-4 text-muted">
          Let me take you on a journey that touched my heart and left an
          indelible mark on my soul. It all started when a social worker
          approached me with an opportunity to be a scribe for an individual
          during an exam. She explained it involved reading test questions aloud
          and marking down answers for a disabled person. I was hesitant at
          first - it sounded daunting and I didn't know what to expect. But I
          decided to step outside my comfort zone and help.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-muted">
          <span class="text-white"
            >Walking into the exam center, I met this incredible person.</span
          >
          On exam day, I made my way to the center, nerves building with each
          minute. I was introduced to the examinee, a bright and cheerful woman
          unfazed by the high stakes test ahead. Her positivity and resolve to
          succeed despite obstacles amazed me. Who was I to feel anxious when
          she approached this pivotal moment with grace and courage?
        </p>

        <p class="text-muted">
          As the exam began, we worked together in synchronized collaboration. I
          carefully dictated each question, watching in awe as she recalled
          knowledge swiftly and precisely. No hint of worry or doubt ever
          crossed her face, just deep concentration and belief in her abilities.
          She knew this was her chance to gain independence by securing a
          government job. I was humbled and inspired beyond words.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-muted">
          <span class="text-white"
            >Post-exam, the call came, and it was one of triumph and
            elation.</span
          >
          The hours flew by, and suddenly the exam was over. Weeks later, I
          received incredible news - she had passed the exam and qualified for
          the position! The joy and gratitude in her voice when she called to
          tell me brought me to tears. This was a turning point in her life, a
          dream realized, and I had played a small but important role.

            >This experience was a game-changer for me.</span

          It wasn't just about lending a helping hand; it was about witnessing
          the ripples of change that even a small act of kindness can set in
          motion.

            >Fueled by this encounter, I set out on a new mission.</span
          >
          As a software engineer, I wanted to amplify this impact. So, I created
          an
          <a
            href="https://www.github.com/nikam-shreyas/sudohelp"
            class="text-info"
            >android application</a
          >. This app would be the bridge, connecting eager volunteers with
          upcoming exams. It was about making the process smoother, removing
          barriers, and encouraging more folks to join in.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-muted">
          <span class="text-white"
            >This journey of giving back has been nothing short of incredible. </span
          >It's taught me that the power to light up lives is within each of us.
          We just need to heed the call, to step up and make a difference, no
          matter how small it may seem at the start.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-muted">
          And I can't wrap this up without giving a huge shoutout to my
          colleague,
          <a
            class="text-info"
            href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/himani-gwalani-325066b8/"
          >
            Himani Gwalani</a
          >. She's the one who introduced me to this beautiful world of
          volunteering, and I'll forever be grateful for that. She opened the
          door to a realm of possibilities, to the joy of making a positive
          impact.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-muted">
          So, there you have it, a slice of my first volunteering adventure.
          It's a story I carry with me, a reminder of the incredible potential
          we all hold to light up the world, one act of kindness at a time.
